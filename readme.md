- The project involves creating a website dedicated exclusively to one cuisine, with recipes from only one country and chef.
- The website has a unique design, including a navbar with the website name, home, blog, and user profile picture, and a footer that appears on all pages.
- The registration page includes fields for name, email, password, and photo URL, and displays errors for incomplete or incorrect submissions.
- The home page includes a banner, chef section with at least six cards, and at least two additional sections.
- When clicking the View Recipes button, users are redirected to the Chef Recipes page, which includes a banner, recipe info in a tabular form or card group and a favorite button that shows a toast message when clicked.
